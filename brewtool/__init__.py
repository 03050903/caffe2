"""Brew tool for Caffe2.

This is a simple tool inspired by the build systems such as Bazel and Buck. It
is intended that all components are built with pure Python so that one does not
need any external dependencies.

If you are modifying this, make sure that you do not introduce any complex
dependencies that are not built-in Python modules.
