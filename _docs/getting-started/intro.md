[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caffe2/caffe2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caffe2/caffe2)

Welcome to Caffe2! This page will help you install Caffe2 on your system, allowing you to get started using it for [deep learning](/docs/learn-more#what-is-deep-learning).

If you already have Caffe2 installed on your system, you can:

- Take a [detailed dive](/docs/learn-more) into the concepts around [deep learning](/docs/learn-more#what-is-deep-learning) and [Caffe2](/docs/learn-more#why-use-caffe2).
- Start running the [tutorials](/docs/tutorials).

The instructions are a bit different depending on your target platform, whether you want to build Caffe2 from source, etc. In the above toggler, select your platform and how you want to install Caffe2 on that platform.

> There are some external [demos](/docs/learn-more.html#getting-started-with-caffe2__demos) you can try if you want to see Caffe2 in action and/or do not want to yet install Caffe2 on your system.
