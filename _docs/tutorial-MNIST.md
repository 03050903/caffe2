This tutorial creates a small convolutional neural network (CNN) that can identify handwriting. The train and test the CNN, we use handwriting imagery from the MNIST dataset. This is a collection of 60,000 images of 500 different people's handwriting that is used for training your CNN. Another set of 10,000 test images (different from the training images) is used to test the accuracy of the resulting CNN.
